Hello! My name is Saumya Gupta. I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, where I am advised by Professor [Chao Chen](https://chaochen.github.io/). 

My research interests are in the areas of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Topological Data Analysis, and Medical Image Analysis.
